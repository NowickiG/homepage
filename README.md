## Hello programmers !!!
I am a beginner programmer from Poland. I have just started the Frontend Developer course from scratch, in my case really from scratch, because I have never had anything to do with programming before. It is not easy, but as they say: "Everything beautiful - is born from pain.
## General information
The site contains direct information about me,<br>
*- where I come from,*<br>
*- what I did in the past and what I am doing now.*<br>

The work was created as part of the YouCode programmer course.<br>
I will try to update my site regularly, in the meantime improving my English üòÅ.<br>
